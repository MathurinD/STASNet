The library contains the levmar-package (version 2.5) for optimization (c) by Manolis Lourakis
(see src/levmar-2.5/README.txt)

---

This library can be used to model signalling perturbation data using models that are derived from
Modular Response Analysis, in a way described in Klinger et al, 2013 using R. 

Requires the following libraries to be installed: 
									boost
									blas
									ginac
									cls
									gmp

To install it, first compile the library, install it, then install the R-package. 

Linux installation guide:
Open shell go to the folder of the package (“MRA_Signaling”)
and execute: 
			autoreconfigure -fi
			./configure –prefix=$HOME
			export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
			export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
			export CPATH=$HOME/include
			make
			make install
first create a folder for local R library in (e.g “home/<Username>/R”)
if necessary open R and install dependent packages:
install.packages(“Rccp”,”igraph”,”pheatmap”,lib=<local library path>) 
close R open shell go to “MRA_Signaling/Rsrc” folder 
execute: R CMD INSTALL fitmodel (when recompiling use R CMD INSTALL –preclean fitmodel)				


Have fun with it!
