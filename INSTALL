Requires the following packages to be installed: 

boost
blas
ginac
cls
gmp


To install, use the standard autoconf-like build order:

./configure 
(For a local install : ./configure --libdir=$HOME --exec-dir=$HOME for a local install, with  R_LIBS_USER="$HOME" in your ~/.Renviron, and LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib and LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib in your $HOME/.bashrc)
make
make install 

then install the R-package by:

cd Rsrc
R CMD INSTALL fitmodel

once installed, open R and execute example.R in r_binding, which will start to build a model and fit it to data.
