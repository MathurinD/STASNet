Requires the following packages to be installed: 

boost
blas
ginac
cls
gmp


To install, use the standard autoconf-like build order:

./configure 
make
make install 

then install the R-package by:

cd r_binding
R CMD INSTALL fitmodel

once installed, open R and execute example.R in r_binding, which will start to build a model and fit it to data.
