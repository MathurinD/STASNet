**NOTE** Various scripts are available in the inst/ folder of `STASNet` to run the fitting procedure from the command line

Loading the library:
```{r}
library(STASNet)
```

## Example dataset
```{r, eval=T}
# Structure as adjacency list
structure = rbind(c("N1", "N2"), c("N2", "N3"), c("N2", "N5"), c("N5", "N4"), c("N3", "N4"))
basal = c("N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5")
midas_data = as.data.frame(matrix(0, nrow=4, ncol=7,
    dimnames=list(NULL, c("ID:type", "TR:N1", "TR:N2i", "DA:ALL", "DV:N2", "DV:N3", "DV:N4"))))
midas_data[,1] = c("c", "t", "t", "t") # Type of experiment
midas_data[,c(2,3)] = cbind(c(0,1,1,0), c(0,0,1,1)) # Perturbations
midas_data[,c(5:7)] = cbind(c(111, 250, 187, 98), c(100, 150, 147, 76), c(103, 600, 217, 54)) # Experimental values
print(midas_data)
```

## Creation of the model

Create the model using the data and the network layout as prior knowledge.

**NOTE** Depending on the number of initialisations ('inits') and the size of the network it is possible that the global optimum is not reached. Results can thus vary between runs of `createModel()` for big networks with an insufficient number of initialisations.

```{r}
model = createModel(model_links = structure,
                    basal_file = basal,
                    data.stimulation = midas_data,
                    inits = 100,
                    model_name = "example")
```
```{r, echo=F}
#setwd(system.file("extdata", package="STASNet"))
#model = createModel("network.tab", "basal.dat", "HCT116_MIDAS.csv", inits=100, perform_plots=T,
#                    method="randomlhs");
#TODO: replace the HCT116 dataset with the trimed dataset used in the package
```

We can then visualise the resulting network. Be aware that the fitted values are paths and not directly link,
thus the values displayed on a link should not be taken as is (use `printParameters()` to get the actual paths).

```{r}
printParameters(model)
plotModelGraph(model)
```

We can the evaluate how the simulation compares to the data.

```{r,fig.width=4}
plotModelAccuracy(model)
plotModelScores(model)
simulation = plotModelSimulation(model, with_data= TRUE,log_axis = T)
print(simulation)
```

## Profile likelihood

Profile likelihood aims at providing confidence intervals for the parameters. `niplotPL()` provides a convenient way to plot the likelihood and profiles of parameters.

```{r,fig.width =4.9}
profiles = profileLikelihood(model, nb_points = 1000, nb_cores = 8)
model = addPLinfos(model, profiles)
niplotPL(profiles, file_plots = FALSE)
```

Note the correlation between N2->N3 and N2->N4->N5 which indicates a structural non identifiability, i.e. the experimental design does not allow to differentiate between them.
Note also the symmetry around 0 for the inhibitor iN2 due to the fact that it is always considered negative for the fit.

The parameter confidence intervals can be visualised.

```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=6}

plotModelParameters(model)
```

We can then simulate with confidence intervals.

```{r,fig.width =4}
simulation = plotModelSimulation(model, with_data= TRUE,log_axis = T)
```

## Network structure alteration
Next to the parameterisation also the structural sanity of the network can be assessed by searching for superfluous or missing connections.

First we try to reduce the network in oder to test for links that do not significantly contribute to the overall fit
```{r}
red_model = selectMinimalModel(model)
```

In the model two links are found to be neglectable and the thusly reduced model is returned as output of `selectMinimalModel()`

After haveing reduce th model it is also of interest to search for missing links that would improve the overall fit.
In contrast to the reduction this is done by returning a list which contains teh statistics of each link so that the extension can be then manually curated and compared to available biological insights from previous experiments or literature.
```{r,eval =F}
#TODO make ModelStructure to accept a list of all names to always preserve unconnected nodes in the network
ext_mat = suggestExtension(red_model)
```

## Creation of a Model set

A model set is a joint fitting of several dataset with the same model and some links varying independently between models.

```{r, eval=F}
mset = createModelSet("network.tab", "basal.tab", c("Widr_"))
```


```{r, eval=F}
mset = addVariableParameters(mset)
```
