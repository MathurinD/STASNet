The library contains the levmar-package (version 2.5) for optimization (c) by Manolis Lourakis
(see src/levmar-2.5/README.txt)

---

This library can be used to model signalling perturbation data using models that are derived from
Modular Response Analysis, in a way described in Klinger et al, 2013 using R. 

Requires the following C++ libraries to be installed (installation method depends on the OS): 

    ginac
    cln

And the following R packages: 

    Rcpp (>= 0.10.4)
    BH
    RhpcBLASctl
    Rgraphviz
    pheatmap
    lattice
    lhs
    parallel

You can install those packages in R with:

    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite(c("Rccp","BH","RhpcBLASctl","Rgraphviz","pheatmap","lattice","lhs","parallel"))

Unix (MacOS, BSD, GNU/Linux) installation guide:
    For a local installation, first create a folder for local R library in (e.g "home/<Username>/R")
    Open shell go to the folder of the package (“MRA_Signaling”)
    execute: R CMD INSTALL ./ (when recompiling use R CMD INSTALL --preclean ./)

Have fun with it!
