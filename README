The library contains the levmar-package (version 2.5) for optimization (c) by Manolis Lourakis
(see src/levmar-2.5/README.txt)

---

This library can be used to model signalling perturbation data using models that are derived from
Modular Response Analysis, in a way described in Klinger et al, 2013 using R. 

Requires the following C++ libraries to be installed (installation method depends on the OS): 
						ginac
						cln
And the following R packages: 
						Rcpp (>= 0.10.4)
						RhpcBLASctl
                                    		Rgraphviz
                                    		pheatmap
						lattice
						lhs
						parallel
						
You can install those packages in R with:

install.packages(“Rccp”,"RhpcBLASctl",”Rgraphviz”,”pheatmap”,"lattice","lhs","parallel",lib=<local library path>)

Unix (MacOS, BSD, GNU/Linux) installation guide:
For a local installation, first create a folder for local R library in (e.g "home/<Username>/R")
Open shell go to the folder of the package (“MRA_Signaling”)
execute: R CMD INSTALL ./ (when recompiling use R CMD INSTALL --preclean ./)

Have fun with it!
