The library contains the levmar-package (version 2.5) for optimization (c) by Manolis Lourakis
(see src/levmar-2.5/README.txt)

---

This library can be used to model signalling perturbation data using models that are derived from
Modular Response Analysis, in a way described in Klinger et al, 2013 using R. 

To install it, first compile the library, install it, then install the R-package. 

Have fun with it!
