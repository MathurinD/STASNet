Input: Multiple Datasets with the same experimental layout

Goal: Model with joint and distinct parameters

- write a superclass Uebermodel that derive from model and overwrites eval()

new eval() function has to interprete parameters differnently:
    - we have N*nr_parameters(), where the first nr_parameters() parameters are the once for the first cell lines, and the rest (N-1) * nr_parameters() are the difference to the fitst cell line
    - calls original eval function for each cell line and adds up scores
    - eval needs to be able to take several Data sets
    

write a wrapper that
