Input: Multiple Datasets with the same experimental layout

Goal: Model with joint and distinct parameters

- write a superclass Uebermodel that derive from model and overwrites eval()

new eval() function has to interprete parameters differnently:
    - we have N*nr_parameters(), where the first nr_parameters() parameters are the once for the first cell lines, and the rest (N-1) * nr_parameters() are the difference to the fitst cell line
    - calls original eval function for each cell line and adds up scores
    - eval needs to be able to take several Data sets
    

write a wrapper that


Evaluation improvements on R side:

- Implement a routine that looks for feedbacks that can be envisioned and ranks them according to the chi2 improvement 
- Implement network representation form with all identifiable parameters depicted (if combinations set all but one to 1 and give them a unique color!!!)
- Profile Likelihood improvements:
	(1) change upper threshold settings (max=upper threshold +1/5 of inter confidence threshold range) (not ylim in the data !!!)
	(2) seperate nonidentifiable figure from identifiable figures as file dimensions get messed up to being unreadbale for the latter
	(3) in identifiable figures shows names for changed parameters shown on the left (only those that do change!!!)
	(4) detect parameter constellations that are better than the optimal fit has found in the first place and report those (replace those?) 
- Include the actual measurements (with error bar) to compare model prediction in the Predict Model bar graphs (simulations without actual data should still be possible) 
- Change names in reasonable names (e.g. MIDAS_adjacency_100k.mra  -> MRA_model_100k.mra
- Accuracy_heatmap adjust scaling to the same color coding for simulation and data !!! (so take the combined limits for both and transfer them)
