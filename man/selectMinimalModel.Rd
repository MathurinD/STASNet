\usage{
reduceModel(original_model, accuracy = 0.95, verbose = F, output_file = "")

selectMinimalModel(
  original_model,
  accuracy = 0.95,
  verbose = F,
  output_file = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_model}{An MRAmodel object, as the one produced by createModel or importModel}

\item{accuracy}{Probability threshold, the type I error for each link will be 1-accuracy. Multiple testing is not taken into account.}
}
\value{
An MRAmodel object of the reduced model with the data
}
\description{
Selection of a minimal model by iteratively removing insignificant links using the likelihood ratio test.
reduceModel is an alias for selectMinimalModel.
